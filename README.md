Part I

Tic Tac Toe is a very popular game played by many children all over the world. You will re-create this game using your knowledge of arrays, methods and loops. Here are the program specifications:

Build a 1-player game: the player against the computer.
Find a resource online that explains how the game is played. This will be your documentation.  Include the URL of your documentation in a comment. 
Use a two-dimensional array to represent the game board.
Use a nested for loop to initialize the multi-dimensional array with some neutral value (a dash is a sensible choice).
Include comments to clarify any code whose purpose is not obvious 
You must have a separate method to do each of the following:

Initialize the board (use a nested for loop)
Print the game board to the console
Input the player's move
Determine the computer's random move (the computer doesn't need to play intelligently, just legally)
Determine a winner diagonally
Determine a winner horizontally
Determine a winner vertically
Feel free to create additional methods as needed!
